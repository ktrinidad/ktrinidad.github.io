<p>A certified athletic trainer that was born and raised in the suburbs of Los Angeles, CA. I got the nickname "Kat" in elementary school and it has since stuck. In high school when my friends were rushing to become cheerleaders, I found that being part of another team was more rewarding to me. That's when I fell in love with athletic training.</p>

<p>The opportunity to help people and feel like you're making a difference is why I love athletic training. And I mean love it. I studied it as an undergrad at the University of Pacific and earned my Masters of Arts in Athletic Training at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>

<p>As a graduate student, I got the chance to do research for the Matthew Gfeller Sport-Related Traumatic Brain Injury Center at UNC-CH. I got the chance to work with some of the brighest people in sport related brain injury research. Working with them was daunting until you realize that you're all working toward the same goal. To help people.</p>

<p>I've had the chance to be a part of a team of a variety of teams. From middle school baseball, collegiate gymnastics, or professional soccer - I love to watch my athletes do what they love.</p>

<p>I currently reside in Raleigh, NC and I'm looking for the next opportunity to grow my career. I love all things southern and traveling. When I'm not writing rehab notes or making ice bags, I like to run and try new recipes.</p>

<h1><a name="why"></a>Why Athletic Training?</h1>

<p>Most people believe athletic trainers are there just to help athletes that get injured. But I know it's so much more than that.</p>

<p>As an athletic trainer, my job is to not only help the injured - but prevent it in the first place.</p>

<p>Every athlete is different. There is no one size fits all plan. You must cater to each individual's needs to get them back to what they do best. Compete.</p>

<p>I manage the expectations of all the different people involved in sports - the athlete, the coach, the parent, the doctor, the administrator - creating relationships built on respect and trust.</p>

<p>There are lots of challenges in being an atheletic trainer. Often times I am forced to be resourceful. Long nights. Weekends. And distinguishing between normal complaints and actual injuries. It's hard work.</p>

<p>But the reward far outweighs the challenges. You're part of a team and every day you get a chance to help people. That is what fulfills me.</p>

<p>That's why I am an athletic trainer.</p>
